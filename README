Python utilities to backup all tweets. 

Tweepy library is used. To get it

git clone git://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy tweepy_src
mv tweepy_src/tweepy .

In principle calls to API to get user timeline do not require authentication. Still the credentials are read from config.yaml. Move config.yaml.sample and change parameters.

If Twitter thoughs an error, its current state is saved in config.yaml.
